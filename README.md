# Blockchain: Creating a Token Using Smart Contracts

## Intro
This repository has everything you need to create a publicly traded token on a blockchain network. No coding experience necessary. We will be using the Ethereum blockchain and resorces that exist on the cloud.

Here is some basic terminology:
  * **Ether** is the name of the cryptocurrency used in the Ethereum blockchain.
  * **Smart contract** is the script that is executed by the blockchain network.
  * **Solidity** is the coding language used to write smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain.
  * **Node** is one computer in a network.

## FAQ
1. *Do I have to install or download something? I do not trust these blockchain folks their hacker ways...* 

      **No, you do not need to download or install anything**. Even coding is optional (although it does help). If you have the ability to copy and paste and a functioning browser you are good to go. Think of this as baking a cake for the first time.

2. *Do I need cryptocurrency to make my token work? How expensive this is?*

      **You do not need cryptocurrency to create a token**. We will be doing this on the test Ethereum network (known as Ropstein network) using fake Ether. However, you do need Ether if you would like to do the same in the main Etherereum network.  

3. *Can I trade my token using my iPhone or Android wallet?*

      Yes, you can trade the token using an app on your phone. That is part of the fun.

3. *How long will this take?*

      About 20 minutes. Maybe less if you know what you are doing.

4. *Is my token worth something? If so, how much?*
   
      After you finish creating your token it will be worth exactly Zero dollars. That being said, value is never intrinsic to the thing, it is a perceived feature that in most cases evolves over time. So, who knows?   


## Roadmap
Roadmap to creating a publicly traded token with little or no coding experience:
1. Take a deep breath...
2. Install MetaMask extension in your browser. Create a local wallet in MetaMask.
3. Copy the smart contract code that will create the token (...) 
4. Compile the code using a online Solidity compiler https://remix.ethereum.org/
    4.1. Paste the smart contract code in the editor section of the website
    4.2. Click in "Settings" and choose the compiler version ("0.4.16+commit.d7661dd9")
    4.3. Click in "Compile" and check if there are any errors. Green means you are ready to go.
    4.4.
3. Edit the number of tokens, name and code for the token.
4. Compile the code at ()
5.
