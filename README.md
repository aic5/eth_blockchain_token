# Blockchain: Creating a Token Using Smart Contracts

## Intro
This repository has everything you need to create a publicly traded token on a blockchain network. No coding experience necessary. We will be using the Ethereum blockchain and resorces that exist on the cloud.

Here is some basic terminology:
..* **Ether** is the name of the cryptocurrency used in the Ethereum blockchain.
..* **Smart contract** is the script that is executed by the blockchain network.
..* **Solidity** is the coding language used to write smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain.
..* **Node** is one computer in a network.

## FAQ
1. *Do I have to install or download something? I do not trust these blockchain folks their hacker ways...* 
No, you do not need to download or install anything. Even coding is optional (although it does help). If you have the ability to copy and paste and a functioning browser you are good to go. Think of this as baking a cake for the first time.

2. *Do I need cryptocurrency to make my token work? How expensive this is?*
**You do not need cryptocurrency to create a token**. We will be doing this on the test Ethereum network (known as Ropstein network) using fake Ether. However, you do need Ether if you would like to do the same in the main Etherereum network.
